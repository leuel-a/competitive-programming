    Team Composition: Programmers and Mathematicians

Description:
    The All-Berland Team Programming Contest will take
    place very soon. This year, teams of four are allowed
    to participate.

    There are 'a' programmers and 'b' mathematicians at Berland
    State University.

    How many maximum teams can be made if:
        => each team must consist of exactly 4 students,
        => teams of 4 mathematicians or 4 programmers are
            unlikely to perform well, so the decision was
            made not to compose such teams.

    Thus, each team must have at least one programmer and
    at least one mathematician.

    Print the required maximum number of teams. Each person
    can be a member of no more than one team.
