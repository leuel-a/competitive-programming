"""Defines the Solution class for the LeetCode problem 973

Description:
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents
    a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest
    points to the origin (0, 0).

    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the
    Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is
    guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
