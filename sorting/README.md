<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<h3>1. Bubble Sort</h3>
<p><b>Bubble Sort</b> is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the 
adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for 
large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

<p>Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2)</p>
