<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<h3>1. Bubble Sort</h3>
<p><b>Bubble Sort</b> is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the 
adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for 
large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

<p>Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2)</p>

<h3>2. Insertion Sort</h3>
<p><b>Insertion Sort</b> is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing 
cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values 
from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.</p>
